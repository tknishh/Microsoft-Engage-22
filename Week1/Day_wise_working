Day 2:

Date - 5th May 2022

First AMA session (3pm-4pm)
A member of Microsoft team addressed to confusion/questions of students regarding challenges. They elaborated about all the challenges 
and what they expect from Mentees and explained the judging criteria.

Personally I choose 3rd challenge which is Based on ALgorithms. One has to create an application revolving around a recommendation system 
which recommends (songs in my case) and demonstrates use of various types of algorithm sets like sorting, searching and choose best one (and why?)
which will be used to achieve the target.

Also decided how to proceed on my recommendation system model.
